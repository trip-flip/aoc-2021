# Advent of Code 2021
Advent of Code 2021 Solutions (Unfinished)

## Languages and dependencies
*All puzzles were developed on my Linux machine (Arch user btw :^))*

* General scripting tools (Make)
* C (GCC)
* Java (OpenJDK, meaning `javac` and `java`)
* JavaScript (node)
* Rust (cargo)

### Notes:
* Would've stuck with rustc when I used Rust, however intellisense for VSC
didn't work without it apparently.
